Our design services include topographic surveys, drafting, preliminary & detailed design, as well as costruction cost estimates, contract document preparation, and permit applications.

#### Topographic Survey
Our survey work ranges from: developed to undeveloped sites; a single property to multiple properties/sites; a short section of roadway to multiple kilometres long; foreshore surveys; long linear surveys, such as water transmission mains or sanitary sewer trunk/forcemans; and areas covering kilometres in length and width.

#### Drafting
Drawings are developed utilizing the most current AutoCAD Civil 3D software package on our local area network of high performance CAD stations.  Field survey data from our robotic survey instruments are downloaded complete with point descriptions into the base drawing.  The drawing layout, line type, line styles, and fonts can be customized to meet the requirements of the various Vancouver Island municipalities.

#### Preliminary Design
Preliminary design is the taking a design concept and putting into a drawing.  The preliminary design presents the broad overall scope of the project and the general framework of what is to be constructed.

#### Detailed Design
Detailed design drawings present, in detail, what is to be constructed.  During the detailed design development process, design drawings are submitted to the approving agencies for review and comment to ensure the design process is meeting the end product requirements.  This typically involves submission of design drawings at the 50% and 75% to 95% stage of completion.

#### Construction Cost Estimates
Our construction cost estimates are typically developed using our in-house library of construction costs from similar projects completed recently within the mid-island area with the addition of supplier quotes for any specialty equipment.

#### Contract Document Preparation
Many of our staff are very familiar with the preparation of Master Municipal Construction Documents (MMCD) or our own in-house construction contracts for effective control of project budget and timeline, including the addition of specialty technical specifications as required.

#### Permit Applications
Koers is familiar with the permitting and approvals processes of the majority of regulating bodies, local municipalities, and third party utilities encountered in the mid-island region, including municipalities, regional districts, MoTI, MoE, DFO, Fortis BC, BC Hydro, Shaw, Telus, and others.
