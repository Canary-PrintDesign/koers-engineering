We offer project management services, commissioning, record drawing, and tender & contract administration. We also provide construction inspection & layout surveys.

#### Tender Administration
We often administer construction tenders for our design projects.  This would include release of tender documents to contractors, responding to tenderer questions, opening and review of tender packages and recommendation of award.

#### Contract Administration
For many of our projects we provide contract administration through the construction phase of the project.  Most commonly used construction contracts include our in-house developed contract or the Master Municipal Construction Documents (MMCD) contract.

#### Project Management
A Koers project manager typically works closely with the client and contractor through the construction stage helping to coordinate the various parties involved and liaise between the contractor and the client.

#### Construction Layout Survey
At Koers & Associates we have several experienced construction surveyors on staff, each with a robotic survey instrument.  Our versatile construction inspectors are often able to combine site visits with inspection, layout and/or record survey duties providing efficiencies.

#### Construction inspection
The only way to ensure that a project is built in accordance with the design is to inspect the product for conformance with the design drawings and specifications.  Koers has experienced full time construction inspectors on staff capable of providing quick response time for quality assurance on local projects.

#### Record Drawing Preparation
Record drawings are a vital part of asset management.  Koers CAD staff can provide record drawings for any of our projects using information from our construction inspectors and the contractor.

#### O&M Manual Preparation
Koers often prepares or assists in preparation of operation and maintenance manuals for facilities including mechanical equipment such as water and sewage pump stations and treatment plants.
