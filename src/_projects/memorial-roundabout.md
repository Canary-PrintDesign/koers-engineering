As part of the Town of Qualicum Beach Waterfront Master Plan, the Town planned to invest in improvements to the intersection of Memorial Ave and Hwy 19A which included a roundabout, modifications to the seawall, a waterfront walkway and viewing platform, and a revitalization of the Beach Creek Estuary. Koers & Associates provided detailed design and project management of the utility upgrades and intersection improvements, as well as project management of the observation deck, coastal spit, and Beach Creek estuary enhancements.  

The intersection improvements included replacement of existing utilities, underground conversion of overhead BC Hydro, Telus & Shaw infrastructure, roundabout conversion, architectural features, plantings, sidewalks, and bike lanes.  The roundabout conversion included raising the intersection elevation for projected future sea level rise, modifications to the existing seawall, and challenging geometry constraints between the foreshore and the existing hotel and gas station properties and accesses.

The roundabout construction also included a concrete cantilever structure out over the foreshore to accommodate non-vehicle users around the roundabout, as well as modifications to the existing concrete box culvert carrying Beach Creek under the intersection.
