The objective of this project was to upgrade the existing sanitary sewer pump station and forcemain that were installed in the 1980â€™s, in response to proposed development within the catchment area.  Pump Station No. 6 receives flows from the surrounding catchment areas, as well as from pump stations No. 5 & 7, and conveys these flows to the Nanoose Bay Pollution Control Centre.  

The pump station work included removals, bypass pumping, wet well modifications, piping, triplex pump arrangement, and new electrical and controls.  The work also included 185m of 200mm dia. HDPE forcemain and gravity main connections.
