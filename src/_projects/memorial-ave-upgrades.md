The Town of Qualicum Beach is upgrading their core transportation and utility corridor along Memorial Avenue from the downtown core to the waterfront.  Several phases of the work have already been completed, with more under design and construction currently.

Some of the upgrades include a new storm sewer, award winning rain garden/detention pond, intersection realignments, new separated multi-use path, underground conversion of aerial power and communications utilities, MSE retaining wall, streetlighting, road reconstruction, and asphalt overlay.
