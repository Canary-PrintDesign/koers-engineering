  - The community of Bamfield is located on the west coast of Vancouver Island at the southern entrance to Barkley Sound and to the north of picturesque Pachena Bay;  the north entrance to the world renowned West Coast Trail.  The community water system was constructed in 1980 with Sugwaw Lake, located approximately 3 kms to the northeast, as the source and services the approximately 190 permanent residences, businesses and tourists.
  - In 2012, the Alberni-Clayoquot Regional District retained Koers & Associates to undertake a Water System Study, which included a review of water treatment options to meet the Vancouver Island Health Authorityâ€™s Drinking Water Treatment Objectives (Microbiological) for Surface Water Supplies in BC.
  - In 2014, Koers oversaw an on-site pilot testing program to assess the ability of Dissolved Air Floatation (DAF) to treat the water and meet the 4-3-2-1 treatment requirements and quantify the volume and make-up of the waste stream by-product.
  - The preliminary design process commenced in the fall of 2016 and followed by detailed design commencing in the spring of 2017.  Due to the long lead time required for the manufacturing of DAF equipment, it was pre-purchased by the Alberni-Clayoqout Regional District.  Construction commenced in November 2017 and followed by commissioning in June 2018.
  - The water treatment process consists of Dissolved Air Floatation, followed by Rapid Gravity Media Filtration, and disinfection by UV and chlorine (sodium hypochlorite).  The plant has a rated treatment capacity ranging from 310 m3/day to 625 m3/day.
  - Koers managed the project from the feasibility study, through preliminary design, water treatment equipment pilot testing, detailed design obtaining regulatory approvals (Island Health and Ministry of Transportation & Infrastructure), tendering, construction, and commissioning.  Koers was the lead consultant co-ordinating the activities of the specialist sub-consultants (structural, electrical, and geotechnical) and pilot testing equipment suppliers/operators.
