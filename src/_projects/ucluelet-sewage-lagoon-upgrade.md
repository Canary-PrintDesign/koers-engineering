  - The District of Ucluelet operates a 4-cell aerated sewage lagoon located on Hyphocus Island at the southern tip of the District.  Constructed in 1984, the lagoon services the 1,700 residences and businesses of Ucluelet and receives septage from the surrounding area.
  - In June 2016, seepage was found along the toe of the bank below cell no. 1.  Koers was retained by the District to assist with implementing emergency measures to address the problem.  This was followed by  an assessment of the condition of each cell; a review of repair and upgrading options, selection of the preferred option; preparation of detailed design drawings; obtaining regulatory agency approvals; tendering; construction management and commissioning.
  - The project was fast-tracked resulting in the emergency measures, options review, preparation of design drawings and obtaining regulatory approvals being completed within 90 days.  An emergency bypass line was installed to facilitate the bypassing of the lagoon and discharging directly to the ocean outfall.  To increase the treatment capacity, the four cells were dredged, deepened, and the earthen berm between cell 1 and 2 removed.  To improve the treatment process, the inlet to cell 1 was relocated and floating curtain baffle walls were installed in cells 1, 2 and 3 to lengthen the flow path.  The each cell was sealed by installing a HDPE geomembrane liner on the floor and walls.  The lagoons were drained in January and back on-line by April.
