Koers & Associates was tasked with upgrading three of the City of Nanaimo’s existing pressure reducing valve (PRV) stations. This project consists of three locations of PRV stations, at Tom’s Turnabout and Hammond Bay Road, at Bay Street and Neyland Street, and at Townsite Road and Boundary Avenue. 

This project involved replacing existing underground PRV chambers with new operator friendly above ground PRV station kiosks.  The new above ground stations remove the need to enter confined spaces, improve worker safety and reduce operator time and costs.  These stations include 150mm dia. main valves, pressure relief valves, and associated mechanical and site works.
