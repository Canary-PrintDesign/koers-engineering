The City of Port Alberni replaced its aging intake on Bainbridge Lake in response to elevated turbidity readings and an underwater inspection of the existing intake revealing areas of corrosion and holes in the pipe wall.

The project involved design and installation of 165 m of 500 mm diameter HDPE pipe terminating with a fish friendly intake screen submerged at a depth of approximately 11 m.  The design included a 75 mm diameter air supply line for in-place cleaning of the screen on the submerged intake.

Koers managed the project from conceptual design, to obtaining fisheries and environmental approvals, and overseeing construction and commissioning.
