The Harwood Reservoir project was initiated to provide additional capacity for new development and allow for future expansions to facilitate replacement of the existing Aulds Reservoir.  The new concrete reservoir was built with a capacity of 660m3 and includes a plan for a future phase of another 1,300m3 expansion.  

The Harwood Reservoir includes a pump station with three 50 HP pumps with discharge pressures of 300 psi to supply the peak demand for the new development and supply the Foothills Reservoir.
