This project was initiated due to condition failures in the existing twin 600mm and 1050mm dia. CSP culverts carrying Beach Creek across Crescent Rd in Qualicum Beach.  This included replacement of the existing twin culverts with a new 2400mm x 2100mm concrete box culvert with an inlet flow control and embedded for fish habitat and environmental permitting requirements.

This project also included new MSE retaining walls, watermain replacement, existing utility supports, drainage, replanting, irrigation, railings, sidewalks and road restoration.
