The Village of Cumberland retained Koers & Associates as the Prime Consultant for design and construction services for their new water treatment plant and reservoir required to upgrade their water system to current Island Health requirements.  Koers provided design of the civil and process mechanical components as well as overall project management of the interdisciplinary design team of structural, electrical and instrumentation & controls engineers.

The new water treatment plant is sized for a design flow of 112 L/s and includes three UV reactors, onsite hypochlorite generation for chlorine injection, motorized control valves, a new masonry building, and SCADA monitoring and controls.  The new reservoir consists of a bolted steel tank on a concrete foundation with a storage volume of 2,500 m3, accesses, monitoring, controls, and connecting piping.
