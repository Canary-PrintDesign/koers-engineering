  - The District of Lantzville received infrastructure funding to extend the regional sewer system into Lantzville to provide a sanitary sewage collection system to the residents who had historically relied upon individual sewage disposal fields, which in many cases were well beyond their useful lifespan.
  - Koers has been the lead consultant for the Districtâ€™s sewage collection system which, to date, has included extension of the foreshore trunk sewer, over 10 km of new gravity main, 800 m of new forcemain and two lift stations installed over three phases.
