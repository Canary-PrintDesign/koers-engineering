The Town of Qualicum Beach identified an area adjacent to their downtown core that contained some underutilized and industrial properties and rebranded the area as “East Village” for commercial and mixed-use redevelopment.  Koers provided design and project management for utility and streetscape improvements in support of the redevelopment.  The project construction was split into two phases with plans for a future third phase.

The offsite upgrades included streetscape upgrades along Berwick Rd and Second Ave, including “Woonerf” pedestrian & cyclist friendly street design, traffic circles, brick paver sidewalks and road, asphalt paving, ornamental street lights with flower baskets, street trees with soil cell systems, retractable bollards, and mobile vendor power pedestals.  Utility upgrades included upgrading the existing undersized watermain to 200mm dia., new 200mm dia. sanitary sewer, new 250 to 525mm dia. storm sewer and stormwater detention, communications conduit, irrigation, and underground conversion of overhead BC Hydro, Telus & Shaw.

The teamwork with the Contractor, the Town and local businesses helped to minimize the impacts during construction.  The Town has stated that the upgrades “enhance the area's livability for residents and visitors alike”.
