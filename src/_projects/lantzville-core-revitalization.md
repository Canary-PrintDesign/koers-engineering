The District of Lantzville identified a desire to revitalize the streetscape within their commercial core area.  Koers provided design and project management for utility and streetscape improvements in support of the redevelopment.  

The core revitalization upgrades included storm sewer, French drains, road reconstruction, asphalt paving, curbs, brick paver paths and plaza areas, cross walks, parking, signage, and landscaping.  The storm sewer upgrades included 200 meters of 300 to 450mm dia. storm sewer.  The road upgrades included 200 linear meters along Lantzville Road.  This project also required coordination with the surrounding businesses.
