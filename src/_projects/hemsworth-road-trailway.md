paragraphs:
  - Koers & Associates was retained by the Town to oversee upgrading of the Hemsworth Road Trail to improve access and safety for pedestrians, cyclists and electric scooters and provide greater accessibility to the Heritage Forest Trail network.

  - The trail crosses over the fish bearing Beach Creek.  To increase habitat protection and fish spawning, the existing 1800 mm diameter steel culvert was replaced with a 2100 mm diameter concrete culvert.  The culvert invert was embedded below the streambed and a natural streambed created inside the culvert with the placement of streambed gravels.

  - The existing watermain that crossed under the creek bed was replaced with a new watermain in the pathway and overtop of the culvert, improving accessibility for the Townâ€™s public work department staff.
