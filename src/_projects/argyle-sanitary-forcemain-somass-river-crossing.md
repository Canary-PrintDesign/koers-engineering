The City of Port Alberni identified a break in their 450mm dia. AC sewer forcemain transporting one of the Cityâ€™s major sewer catchments to their wastewater treatment plant.  Koers provided design and project management for the replacement of the sewer forcemain with 670m of new 600mm dia. HDPE pipe. 

The new forcemain was installed via directional drilling to cross the Somass River and estuary area.  The installation included several technical and logistical challenges, including challenging geotechnical conditions, maintaining industrial traffic access, environmentally sensitive areas, proximity to BC Hydro transmission wires, and coordination with adjacent landowners and stakeholders.

The new sewer forcemain was successfully installed via directional drilling under the Somass River, reconnected to the existing sections of AC forcemain and brought back online without disturbing the habitat, recreational activities, or traditional uses of the Somass River.
