The City of Port Alberni retained Koers & Associates to oversee the upgrading of its water treatment system in order to comply with Vancouver Island Health Authority’s Drinking Water Treatment Objectives (Microbiological) for Surface Water Supplies in BC.

The City’s water system services a population of approximately 20,000 residents.  The new 300 m2 building houses the three UV reactors, on-site generation of sodium hypochlorite, three electromagnetic flow meters, the system electrical/controls room.  <p> <br> An emergency power generator with an automatic transfer switch was installed in the event of a power loss.  Wooden timbers were incorporated into the building design along with windows to allow for natural lighting and a green roof to mitigate rooftop runoff.  The building was designed to post disaster standards.

Koers was the lead consultant, managing the other design team professionals of Associated Engineering (structural, electrical, instrumentation and controls) and Levelton Consulting Services (geotechnical).
