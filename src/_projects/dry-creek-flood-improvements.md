Koers & Associates was retained by the City to provide detailed design of improvements to the Dry Creek channel through Port Alberni which historically caused regular flooding on commercial streets.

Some of the improvements included 700 linear meters of creek channel reconstruction, including increasing cross section, armouring and habitat improvements, installation of 32m of 3050 x 4200mm box culverts, sediment pond construction, and armouring of banks with gabion baskets & lock block retaining walls.
