The City identified an opportunity for an emergency connection to an alternative water source in the case of an emergency.  This connection required a pump station to pump the water up to the City’s Reservoir No. 8 and from there supply the City’s distribution system.

The emergency connection pump station includes 4 – 500HP split case pumps capable of supplying 145 lps each as well as a 1600 kW diesel generator to power the station.
