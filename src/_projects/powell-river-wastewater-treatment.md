The City of Powell River received funding to consolidate their wastewater treatment into one new plant with secondary treatment of the City’s wastewater. The new design combines all wastewater from the existing plants in Westview, Townsite and the Wildwood lagoon to be directed to the one new consolidated treatment plant near the existing Townsite WWTP. Koers & Associates was retained to design the linear works required to redirect the flows from the previous sites to the new consolidated wastewater treatment plant. 

The linear works on this project included approximately 7km of sewer forcemains, gravity sewers, 720m of watermain, 2 PRV Stations, and 4 Sewage Lift Stations.  The sewer forcemains were 200 – 450mm dia. HDPE pipe.  The watermain was 300mm dia. HDPE pipe.  The sewage lift station pumps ranged from 2 – 70 HP pumps. 

This project included some interesting installations, such as directional drilling, secant pile walls, pipe supports under an existing bridge, and a new steel casing pipe bridge over a creek crossing.  This project also included coordination with third parties, such as BC Ferries, MoTI, First Nations, BC Hydro, and FortisBC.
