The objective of this project was to replace the ageing and undersized 300mm dia. cast iron supply main running from the Upper Cowichan Reservoir to the Burde St Reservoir.  This project was phased over several years to meet budget constraints and staged to prioritize replacement of sections of higher risk first.

The works included 1.6 km of 500mm dia. HDPE supply main and 1.9 km of twin 450mm dia. HDPE supply main and 150mm dia. PVC distribution main, with interconnections, creek crossing and reservoir tie-ins.  Restoration included creek habitat, wooded trails, street pavement, and property frontages.
