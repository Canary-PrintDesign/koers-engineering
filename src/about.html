      <li>City of Nanaimo</li>
      <li>City of Qualicum</li>

      <p>
        Our principle values are quality, integrity, and loyalty. We take great care to deliver these principles to our clients, no matter the project.
      </p>

      <p>
        We encourage all of our employees to take responsibility for every project they work on. We believe that the success of each project
        depends not only on our management team, but on all of us, together. By taking it on ourselves to ensure the successful outcome of every job,
        we've created a company culture of quality and integrity, and that leads to loyal customers and employees.

      <p>
        Reliability is our strong suit - Our clients have relied on us for as long as 30 years.
      </p>

      <p>
        We began our relationship with our longest-running client, the City of Coquitlam, in 1987. Since those early days, we have forged many more long-standing,
        resilient relationships. Our clientele consists of various organizations: Some big, some small, and some that can be traced back to the 1890!
        At <strong>Koers &amp; Associates Engineering Ltd.</strong>, it's trust that our organization is built on, and it's trust that we will continue build.
